# CODE for Signal Image and Video
## by michele yin

In the folder **code** there is the code I used for this project

In the subfolder **code/generator for images or animations** are some python scripts that generated animations used in the presentations

The main scripts used are called **level set { ... } .py**

- ```Level set without redistancing.py``` propagates a level set without doing redistancing and saves an animation

- ```Level set with redistancing.py``` propagates a level set doing redistancing and saves an animation

- ```Level set with gradient.py``` propagates a level set doing redistancing from an image source. The propagations halts at the edges of the image. Saves an animation

- ```Level set notebook.ipynb``` propagates a level set doing redistancing from an image source. The propagations halts at the edges of the image. Saves an animation. Because is it a jupyter notebook it may be more readable and may be used for an eventual lab

In the folder **images** there are the images that were generated by various scripts

- ```Level set with gradient video.py``` I tried to do in a video, but failed miserably

## What are level set ?

A level set of a function $\phi$ is a $\{(x,y): \phi (x,y) = c\}$.

Usually we are insterested in the *zero level set* $\{(x,y): \phi (x,y) = 0\}$.

Here there is a animation of the zero level set of a dynamic curve

They can be used to model dynamic curves with changing topology

The curve $\phi$ moves according to a velocity $F$.

Require to solve a **PDE**

$\frac{ \partial\phi}{\partial t} = F||\nabla \phi||$

Approximate solution by **finite differences**

$\phi(x,y,t+\Delta t) = \phi(x,y,t) - \Delta t F||\nabla\phi||$

But finite differences have approxximation errors

The curve degrades after a while due to numerical errors propagating

A solution is to reinitialize the curve $\phi$ every a number of iterations as the signed difference

$\phi = sign(\phi)(1-||\nabla\phi||)$

Computation of this quantity is done through the library <code> skfmm </code>

Other implementations do not require redistancing/reinitialization

For image processing we use a velocity $F$ that is 0 or close to zero at the edges

$F = \frac{1}{1+||\nabla I||}$

Where $I$ is the image, and $\nabla I$ are the edges according to gradient edge detection

This way we the get contours of the image
